#
# Each heading found in markdown files will be run through this process:
#
# 1. A heading is any line starting with "#" - as the first character on the line.
#
# 2. Pass the heading through all find-replace sequences in this file in the order in which they appear.
#
# 3. If the result of this translation is a blank string, the line will be ignored and no shortcut created. Use this 
#       mechanism to filter out headings you do not want to create shortcuts for. 
#
# 4. Replace all space with a hyphen.
#
# 5. Change all to lower case.
#
# 6. Remove any characters matching [^a-z0-9-].
#
# 4. Add the result to the processed file name to create a new URL shortcut.
#

# Don't generate shortcuts for first level headings. There should only be one first level heading per doc and the 
# shortcut for that will already be represented by the shortcut for the file itself.  
find=^# .*
replace=

find=^#+\s+(\S.*)$
replace=$1

# Remove all trailing and leading space.
find=^\s*(\S.*\S)\s*$
replace=$1

# ROB SPECIFIC.  Don't make a shortcut for the history section.
find=^#*\s+History\s*
replace=
