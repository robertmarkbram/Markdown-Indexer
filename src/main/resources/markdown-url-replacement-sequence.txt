# Each markdown URL created for files found under the ${application.path-to-markdown-files} directory will be run 
# through this process:
#
# 1. Subtract ${application.path-to-markdown-files} from the file's absolute path.
# 2. Run the result through all find-replace sequences in this file  in the order in which they appear.
# 3. Prefix the result with ${application.webapp-base-url}.
